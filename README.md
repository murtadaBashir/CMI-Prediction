This repository contains the official implementation of our framework:
Residual Graph Learning framework (RGLRE) for circRNA–miRNA interaction prediction using Role-aware Graph Embeddings (Role2Vec) and DNABERT-based sequence features.

Features

DNABERT-6 embeddings for circRNA and miRNA sequences.

Role-aware Graph Embeddings (Role2Vec) for interaction-aware representations.

Residual Graph Neural Network with Attention for prediction.

5-Fold Cross Validation with ensemble averaging.

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUROC, AUPR.

Plots: ROC and PR curves across folds.
