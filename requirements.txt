torch should be installed with the right CUDA version for your GPU (e.g., pip install torch==2.0.1+cu118 from PyTorch website)

torch-geometric sometimes requires extra wheels (torch-scatter, torch-sparse, etc.), but if youâ€™re on PyTorch Geometric 2.3+, pip install torch-geometric should handle it.

transformers is needed for DNABERT feature extraction.
